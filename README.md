# Project Elysium: Log Based Storage Engine

Inspired by the [Log Structure Merge-Tree](https://github.com/keyvanakbary/learning-notes/blob/master/books/designing-data-intensive-applications.md#storage-and-retrieval) outlined in the Designing Data Intensive Applications book.

The project is broken down into three components:
```
- pneuma (WIP: data-structure library)
- logos (WIP: log based storage engine library)
- ontos (TODO: webserver)
```

# Etymology
The word elysium was inspired by the [Trinity Processor](https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/Trinity_Processor) in Xenoblade Chronicles 2 which holds three cores:
```
pneuma: 'breath', as something necessary to life
logos: 'speech', the law/word of God 
ontos: 'machine', with default mode of operation, no-opinion 
```
